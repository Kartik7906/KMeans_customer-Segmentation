# Clustring_customer-Segmentation
This repository contains the code and documentation for performing customer segmentation analysis on a mall dataset. The segmentation is done using KMeans clustering after data preprocessing and cleaning.

# Steps:

# Step 1: Collecting Dataset
The first step involves collecting the dataset containing information about mall customers. The dataset should include features such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

# Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before performing any analysis, it's essential to clean and preprocess the data. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and scaling numerical features if necessary. Additionally, categorical features may need encoding for further analysis.

# Step 3: Finding the Optimal Number of Clusters
To perform KMeans clustering effectively, it's crucial to determine the optimal number of clusters. This is done using the elbow method, which calculates the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different numbers of clusters and identifies the point where the decrease in WCSS starts to slow down (the "elbow").

# Step 4: Clustering and Plotting
Once the optimal number of clusters is determined, KMeans clustering is applied to segment the customers. After clustering, the clusters are visualized using plots, typically with different colors representing different clusters. This visualization helps identify distinct customer segments and understand their characteristics.
